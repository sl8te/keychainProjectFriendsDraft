# keychainProjectFriendsDraft
This is just a temporary repository for me to practice the friends page from the Keychain project. This will be used to implement the user's friends list with links to each of their keychains. When the user clicks on a friends keychain link they are taken to a page where they can view the friend's individual keys (profiles/links to social media, gaming, or contact websites).  
I'm making this seperate so that I can view the friends page layout without waiting for the backend to be finished with the Keychain project.
